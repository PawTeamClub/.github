# About Paw

Paw is a Furry rhythm game community formed by **[\[Paw\]FIood](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/6336721)**, aiming to bring together Furries who play osu!, allowing everyone to communicate and interact together.

Each Furry in the community has their own unique characteristics, with everyone excelling in their respective areas, making them distinct and one-of-a-kind individuals.

The hope is for this community to become a place that everyone is willing to visit regularly.
